# Profile Management Service Migration

## Overview
Successfully reorganized AI functionality from the misplaced `services/scoring-engine/src/ai` directory to a new, properly structured `services/profile-management` service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Structure Creation
- Created new `services/profile-management/src/ai/{flows,templates}` directory structure
- Moved all AI flows from scoring engine to profile management service

### 2. AI Flows Migrated
The following AI flows were moved and properly connected:

#### Profile Building Flows
- **`employment-text-parser-flow.ts`** - Parses employment history from text input
- **`project-text-parser-flow.ts`** - Parses project details from text input  
- **`skill-parser-categorizer-flow.ts`** - Extracts and categorizes skills from text
- **`background-information-builder.ts`** - Builds professional background through AI conversation

#### Resume & Cover Letter Generation
- **`resume-generator.ts`** - Generates tailored resumes
- **`cover-letter-generator.ts`** - Creates cover letters
- **`summary-generator.ts`** - Generates professional summaries
- **`job-description-analyzer.ts`** - Analyzes job descriptions

### 3. Import Path Updates
- Fixed all import paths in moved AI flows (`@/ai/genkit` → `../genkit`)
- Created new `src/lib/profile-management-service.ts` to properly expose AI functions
- Updated application imports from `@/lib/scoring-service` to `@/lib/profile-management-service`

### 4. Type System Fixes
- Exported proper TypeScript types from profile management service
- Fixed parameter typing issues in store (`toggleSkillAssociationForProject`)
- Corrected return types for AI helper functions
- Removed invalid type imports (`EmploymentHistory`, `Skills`, `Projects`)

### 5. Components Updated
The following components now properly import from the profile management service:

- **`ProfileTabContent.tsx`** - Main profile editing interface
  - `parseEmploymentText` - For parsing employment text blocks
  - `parseProjectText` - For parsing project descriptions  
  - `parseAndCategorizeSkills` - For skill extraction and categorization

- **`BackgroundBuilder.tsx`** - AI-driven background builder
  - `buildBackgroundInformation` - For conversational background building

### 6. Service Architecture
```
services/
├── profile-management/          # NEW: User profile AI functionality
│   └── src/ai/
│       ├── flows/              # All profile-related AI flows
│       ├── templates/          # AI prompt templates
│       ├── genkit.ts          # Genkit configuration
│       └── dev.ts             # Development utilities
├── scoring-engine/             # Resume scoring (AI removed)
├── company-intel/              # Company research 
└── shared/                     # Shared types and utilities
```

## Integration Points

### Profile Management Functions
- **Employment Parsing**: `parseEmploymentText(textBlock)` - Extracts job details
- **Project Parsing**: `parseProjectText(textBlock)` - Extracts project information  
- **Skill Categorization**: `parseAndCategorizeSkills(textBlock)` - Identifies and categorizes skills
- **Background Building**: `buildBackgroundInformation(input)` - Interactive AI conversation

### UI Integration
1. **Project Text Parser** - Connected to "Add Project" functionality in ProfileTabContent
2. **Employment Parser** - Connected to "Add Employment" functionality  
3. **Skill Categorizer** - Used when adding new skills through the AI-powered categorization system
4. **Background Builder** - Integrated as AI Background Builder section in profile

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Logical Service Separation**: AI flows are now in the appropriate service based on functionality
2. **Clean Architecture**: Profile management is separate from resume scoring
3. **Proper Type Safety**: All TypeScript types are correctly exported and imported
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns between services
5. **Build Success**: Application builds without errors and warnings

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build successful  
- ✅ All import paths updated correctly
- ✅ Type system properly configured
- ✅ Component functionality preserved

The profile management AI functionality is now properly organized and ready for development and deployment.
