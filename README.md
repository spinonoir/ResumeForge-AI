## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

### Profile Building Pipeline
```
User Narrative → Parsing Agents → Comprehensive Profile Storage
    ↓                ↓                      ↓
Employment        Project               Education
 Agent            Agent                  Agent
    ↓                ↓                      ↓

## 🎯 How It Works

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Profile Building
1. **Narrative Input**: Provide detailed descriptions of your work experience, projects, and background
2. **AI Parsing**: Specialized agents extract and structure comprehensive data
3. **Verbose Storage**: Maintain rich, detailed records of all achievements and context
4. **Skill Categorization**: Organize technical and soft skills with proficiency levels

### Phase 2: Job-Specific Optimization
1. **Job Analysis**: AI analyzes job description for requirements and company context
2. **Content Selection**: Intelligent selection of most relevant employment and project experience
3. **Semantic Rewriting**: Transform verbose descriptions into concise, targeted content
4. **Bullet Point Optimization**: Select and rewrite achievements for maximum impact
5. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure consistency, eliminate redundancy, validate effectiveness

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement
1. **Scoring Integration**: Validate resume quality through comprehensive scoring engine
2. **Feedback Loop**: Use scoring results to refine selection and optimization algorithms
3. **Iterative Enhancement**: Continuously improve resume effectiveness based on performance data
